# Hack4Good2021

This project was a submission for the Hack4Good hackathon organized by Developer Student Club NUS, and we achieved the finalist position.

# Aim

Our website aims to help job-seeking applicants better reflect their understanding and interests.

We found out that employers do not have the necessary time to parse through all of the applicant's work to see if they are the right fit for the job. As such, applicants that are just starting out and do not have the relevant job experience may lose out, even if they have spent much time on relevant projects.

We aim to solve that by parsing through the applicant's portfolio, and allow employers to decide at a glance if the tools the applicants have been using will make them a relevant fit for the employer's company.

# Implementation

For the hackathon, we managed to link up to a user's LinkedIn and Github account.  
We made a dictionary of terms, parsing through all the repositories of the user, and detected the libraries that were used, and mapped them to simple terms employers could understand, such as IO Processing, as well as the programming languages that were used.

Other ideas that we thought were worth exploring in the future included scraping other hobbist or professional websites, such as Behance or Dribbble.
